 abstract = {In pluripotent cells, a delicate activation-repression balance
maintains pro-differentiation genes ready for rapid activation.
The identity of transcription factors (TFs) that specifically
repress pro-differentiation genes remains obscure. By targeting
~1,700 TFs with CRISPR loss-of-function screen, we found that
ZBTB11 and ZFP131 are required for embryonic stem cell (ESC)
pluripotency. ZBTB11 and ZFP131 maintain promoter-proximally
paused Polymerase II at pro-differentiation genes in ESCs. ZBTB11
or ZFP131 loss leads to NELF pausing factor release, an increase
in H3K4me3, and transcriptional upregulation of genes associated
with all three germ layers. Together, our results suggest that
ZBTB11 and ZFP131 maintain pluripotency by preventing premature
expression of pro-differentiation genes and present a
generalizable framework to maintain cellular potency.
