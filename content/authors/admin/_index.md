After finishing my medical degree and figuring out my true calling for research I m oved to Berlin to do a Master in Molecular Medicine at the Charite. I then joined the MDC/NYU exchange program for my PhD studies. Durign my PhD I studied how to use the new technology of CRISPR pooled screens to study several elements of gene regulation.
